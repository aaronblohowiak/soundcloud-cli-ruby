soundcloud-cli-ruby
===================

Soundcloud Command-Line Interface in Ruby

It lets you do cool things like search for tracks and create a playlist from the results:

  `sc s tracks -q awsome --fields=id | sc set create --title="My awesome set"`


Help
===

You can always pass `-h` or `--help` to print the help for the current command.  In this way, the entire CLI is discoverable.  Expanded documentation and tips are provided below.

Authentication
======

Soundcloud API requires OAuth for all of its functionality, so you'll need a registered Soundcloud application. If you've never registered a Soundcloud application before, it's easy! Just sign-in using your Soundcloud account and the fill out the short form at http://soundcloud.com/you/apps. If you've previously registered a Soundcloud application, it should be listed at http://soundcloud.com/you/apps.

On your first use of sc-cli, you will be prompted to enter the Client ID, Client Secret, your username and your password.  These will all be sent **directly** to Soundcloud which will provide an `access_token`.  The `access_token` will be written to `$HOME/.sc-cli`.

*Note*: Anyone with access to this file can impersonate you on Soundcloud, so it's important to keep it secure, just as you would treat your SSH private key.


Search
====

```
<%= `sc search -h` %>

````

For most of the searches, you can just `sc search [type] -q [query]`

Example:

```
$ sc search users -q aaronblohowiak
<%= `sc search users -q aaronblohowiak` %>
```

By default, the `permalink_url` of the matched items will be printed with one url per line.  You can change the field or have multiple fields printed by passing them like `--fields=avatar_url,permalink_url`. If you just want the full json response, use the `--json` flag.  For pagination, use the `--limit` and `--offset` parameters.


Here's the output for `sc search tracks -h`:


```
<%= `sc search tracks -h` %>
```


Playlists / Sets
===
`sc` is most useful for creating and deleting playlists.  You can create a playlist by passing the track ids either as a comma-separated list OR by providing a newline-delimited list to STDIN.  This lets you create playlists as part of a pipeline.

  `sc s tracks -q awsome --fields=id | sc set create --title="My awesome set"`

```
<%= `sc playlist create -h` %>
```

There are several other features as well:


```
<%= `sc playlists -h` %>
```


Uploading Tracks
===

You can easily upload a directory's worth of tracks to soundcloud and create a new playlist.

`sc track upload * --fields=id | sc playlist create --title="new playlist"`

The track titles will be the filenames with their extensions stripped off.  Additionally, you could pass in a list of newline-delimited filenames to the command via STDIN.


```
<%= `sc track upload -h` %>
```

Some of the authentication documentation was derrived from the documentation of the `t` ruby gem.
